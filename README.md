## Seed Phrase Generator & Checker (SeedGen)

SeedGen is a tool designed to create a unique set of words that can be used to 
seed a cryptocurrency wallet, enabling users to securely store and access their digital assets. 
These seed phrases are typically made up of a sequence of 12 randomly generated words that act 
as a backup for the wallet. \
The program is designed to search for a lost or forgotten wallet with preserved cryptocurrency

## Features

- Generation of seed phrases of 12 words
- Getting the wallet address from the seed phrase
- Checking wallet balance BTC, ETH, LTC, DOGE


## About the program
It is an open source program that can generate seed phrases and also search for wallets containing BTC, ETH, LTC, DOGE coins.
Compared to other generators written in python, this program is written in C++, which makes it many 
times faster than those. The program also uses multiple threads to check multiple addresses simultaneously, 
ensuring fast and efficient searches. Real-time balance detection

![video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8651f273-af9d-4318-b1ff-e0607981a074)

to start searching for wallets with balance, run the SeedGen.exe
After running, press the '2' key to start searching for wallets.
The program will constantly generate seed phrases and check the balances of linked wallets. Information about each verified wallet will be recorded in the console.
If a wallet with a non-zero balance is found, its information will also be added to found_wallets.txt in the project directory. \
Depending on the characteristics of your computer, I advise you to run 2-4 copies of the program at the same time. This will significantly speed up the search for a wallet with a balance. \
But know that luck is key here.
